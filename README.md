I've been using Linux for years.  I'm beginning to regret getting a windows 11 machine.  I'm trying to cope with all the DOWNGRADES in Windows 11 as compared to XP (or even Windows 7).  I'm just here trying to find a way to make windows 11 USABLE - I can't read the File and Folder Names in File Explorer without eyestrain.  It looks like it's going to take mucking about with the REGISTRY just to change a FONT!!!

I finally got documents that I use constantly on the desktop / taskbar (a LOT of unnecessary trouble), only to find they are SO SLOW to load, I have to actually sit and wait and wait and wait for the document to come up - just in WORDPAD.  Now I'm trying to find a way to fix THAT!!
